KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
o Won't handle repositories with multiple heads correctly.
  I am reworking the graph rep to fix this.

FCP BUGS:
o 1208 SSK reinserts of same data fail with code 9.
  This breaks fn-reinsert.
o 1208 RemoveRequest kills the FCP connection.
  This can cause fn-pull to fail. 
  It should work if you run it again.
