I added an explicit format_version field to the config file
and added code to automatically re-write the config file
when the version changes.  

Disregard the note about fms* config variables below.
They will appear 'automagically'.

I added fn-fmsread and fn-fmsnotify to support sending and
receiving repo update notifications via fms. They are
documented in __init__.py.

The gensig.py script can be use to publish repo updates
in your fms signature.

IMPORTANT:
If you were running an earlier version of the code
you must fn-push or fn-pull successfully at least once
before you will see the new fms* config variables in
your .infocalypse/infocalypse.ini file.

I reworked the graph representation to handle multiple
heads correctly.  

Repositories inserted with the previous code won't work
with the new code because I had to change the 
top key format.

pylint -fparseable --include-ids=y *.py

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
o Won't handle repositories with multiple heads correctly.
  I am reworking the graph rep to fix this.
o Doesn't support hg rollback correctly. 
  I need to dig into this. Advice welcome.

FCP BUGS:
o 1208 SSK reinserts of same data fail with code 9.
  This breaks fn-reinsert.
o 1208 RemoveRequest kills the FCP connection.
  This can cause fn-pull to fail. 
  It should work if you run it again.
