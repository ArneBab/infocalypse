Links to freenet URIs are automatically hypertexted but they only work when the wiki is inserted into Freenet.

Normal 'http:' links are also hypertexted.  They will automatically be converted into the _CHECKED_HTTP_ links when the wiki is inserted into freenet.

Images with links to Freenet URIs are supported, but you can only see them when the wiki is inserted into Freenet.

''Remember'' to use 'freenet:' at the start of the URI.
