'''Minimal wiki skeleton directory to start your wiki from'''

fniki is based on PikiPiki.

TitleIndex has a list of all pages.

These pages have examples of wiki markup:
 * EditingTips, HorizontalRules
 * FreenetOnlyFeatures


Removing pages isn't supported though the wiki interface (yet!).
You can manually remove pages by removing files from the:
{{{
<repo root>/wiki_root/wikitext
}}}
directory.

These pages have embedded macros. You might want to take a look at
the document source before you delete them.
