[details]
Having multiple directories associated with the same request URI means a pull
request cannot reasonably give a directory to pull to. (Or should it give all
matches?)

Having multiple repositories with the same name (in the request URI)
makes pull requests not work (because it uses only name), and makes it more
confusing to refer to repositories.
