I'd issue a "don't do this at home kids"-warning though since the hg update operation contacted github 
for downloading the contrib subdirectory. This is for all those paranoid about disclosing their 
connection to freenet and not trusting github. — Debora_Wöpcke

This happens when doing

    hg clone freenet://USK@3Xvf~RI-N8YC-xFtQIEnEwR~ZLC05UhQjQzKAS0lL4Y,PqTg9Y5Me6~WthiW5FoHG9Mq18c7oRbe0owRutJJJZc,AQACAAE/fred1.R1/120
